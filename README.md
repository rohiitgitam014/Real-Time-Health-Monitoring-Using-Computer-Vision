Health Monitoring Using Computer Vision
1. Executive Summary
This project presents an innovative health assessment tool using real-time video analysis and machine learning. By analyzing facial cues through a webcam, it predicts whether an individual is "Healthy" or "Unwell". This non-invasive approach has wide applicability in healthcare, fitness, and workplace safety.

2. Project Overview
Objective:
To develop a system that utilizes computer vision and ML to predict a userâ€™s health status via webcam feed.

Key Features:

Real-time webcam input

Facial detection via OpenCV

Machine learning model for prediction

Live visual feedback overlay

3. Problem Statement
Early symptoms of illness (like fatigue or poor skin tone) are often missed in traditional checks. This system leverages computer vision to provide instant, non-contact health monitoring, enhancing early detection and preventive care.

4. Technical Architecture
Component	Description
Camera Input	Captures live video via webcam
Face Detection	Haar cascades (OpenCV)
Feature Extraction	RGB-based facial feature analysis
ML Model	Trained classifier (e.g., RandomForest)
Prediction	Outputs "Healthy" or "Unwell"
UI Display	Real-time overlays on webcam feed
5. Technologies Used
Python, OpenCV, Scikit-learn

NumPy, Joblib

Tkinter / Streamlit

PyInstaller (for executable packaging)

6. Business Use Cases
Industry	Use Case
Healthcare	OPD/ICU patient monitoring

Scalable across multiple industries

8. Future Scope
CNN-based deep learning for better accuracy

LSTM/GRU models for health trend prediction

Remote vital sign detection (e.g., pulse via PPG)

Cloud-based mobile/web access

9. Deliverables
Trained model: health_predictor.pkl

Python script for live monitoring

GUI-based application

Full source code and technical documentation

Complete business + technical report

10. Conclusion
This project offers a low-cost, real-time, AI-driven health monitoring solution that is practical, scalable, and potentially transformative in the domains of healthcare and personal wellness.
